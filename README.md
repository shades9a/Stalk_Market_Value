# Final Project - Machine Learning

## Objective

In this project we are using a LSTM Model of machine learning to assist in predicting closing stock prices. Although other factors come into play when trying to predict the stock market value, we decided to use closing price since it allows us to put all stocks on the same playing field.

## What We Did

In this project we utilized a new python library, Dash, that not only allowed us to use HTML within python but also created a short-cut and allowed us to deploy our app using flask within the python code.

We utilized LSTM, Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network, to assist with our machine learning predictions. This RNN allowed us to take advantage of the stocks time sequence as well as allowed us to use the deep learning model to make forcasted predictions.

While doing the LSTM model we also took time to visualize the stock information that we were able to obtain and show how even though the price may change the stock could still close positively or negatively. We utilized Tableau for the visualizations and also added a line graph to show a five year overview of the stocks we selected to run the model on.

We then put all these pieces together by creating a HTML code that would host all our images of the model we ran, and float the page through GitHub. Though we could not create the connection through Heroku, we were still able to have the app run through our local machines. The web link includes our Tableau visuals, along with the screen shots of the app working through flask.
